## 🧭 An Interactive Cyberpunk Quiz Platform

**QuizCraft** is a futuristic, cyberpunk-themed quiz platform where developers can test and sharpen their coding knowledge. It merges a high-energy, neon-infused aesthetic with a robust, feature-rich user experience. It's built on a foundation of vanilla web technologies, showcasing what's possible with clean code and a strong creative vision.

> “In every line of code, there's a new challenge. In every challenge, a lesson. In every lesson, mastery.”

### 🌌 Vision: Making Learning an Experience

Technical learning platforms are often sterile and uninspired. QuizCraft’s vision is to transform learning from a transactional task into an immersive experience. It's a space where the challenge of a quiz meets the thrill of a futuristic digital world, making the process of learning not just effective, but deeply engaging and memorable.

### The QuizCraft Difference

| Pillar | What It Means | How QuizCraft Expresses It |
|---|---|---|
| **Engagement** | Keeping users invested and motivated. | Timed questions, interactive feedback, sound effects, and a persistent analytics system that tracks growth. |
| **Aesthetics** | A beautiful and consistent visual language. | A rich cyberpunk theme with glassmorphism, neon glows, animated gradients, and custom fonts. |
| **Persistence** | Remembering user progress without a backend. | All quiz results and theme preferences are saved to the browser's Local Storage. |
| **Modularity** | Clean, manageable, and scalable code. | The logic is separated into distinct modules: a Quiz Engine, a Theme Manager, and core application logic. |

## 🌟 Stand-Out Experience Features

### 1. Advanced Multi-Theme Engine
QuizCraft includes a sophisticated theme manager with six distinct themes. It features a dynamically generated pop-up selector with multi-level interaction on the theme toggle button (single-click, double-click, triple-click) and keyboard shortcuts.

### 2. Fully Client-Side Persistence
Without any backend, the application tracks and displays user analytics across sessions. It reads a detailed log of all quiz attempts from Local Storage to calculate and display aggregate stats like average accuracy and total time spent.

### 3. Immersive Cyberpunk Aesthetic
The entire UI is built with a consistent and engaging visual language, featuring glassmorphism, neon glows, animated gradients, custom futuristic fonts, and subtle sound effects to create a deeply immersive experience.

### 4. Modular Vanilla JavaScript Architecture
The project is a showcase of what can be achieved with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The logic is cleanly separated into modules like a `QuizEngine`, `ThemeManager`, and a core `QuizCraft` class, making it easy to maintain and extend.
